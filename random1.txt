# Enrollment EDA Review (14-Step Revision Guide)

Source notebook reviewed: `scripts/EDA/panda_eda/data_profiling_enrollment.ipynb`

Purpose:
- Quick revision notes for future interview/project recap.
- What you covered in EDA.
- What a data engineer should learn from each step.

---

## Step 1: Business Understanding
What you covered:
- Defined row meaning: enrollment counts by `date + location`.
- Clarified event and measures (`age_0_5`, `age_5_17`, `age_18_greater`).

Data engineer learning:
- Always define business meaning before touching transformations.

## Step 2: Structural Profiling
What you covered:
- Shape, columns, info, head/sample, describe.
- Initial schema and datatype inspection.

Data engineer learning:
- Structural profiling is the first guardrail against schema drift.

## Step 3: Grain Identification
What you covered:
- Natural key evaluated as: `date, state, district, pincode`.
- Duplicate checks at row-level and key-level.

Data engineer learning:
- Grain is the base contract for all downstream modeling.

## Step 4: Duplicate Analysis
What you covered:
- Exact duplicate count and key-duplicate count.
- Duplicate sample review and de-duplication flow.

Data engineer learning:
- You should inspect duplicate examples, not just counts.

## Step 5: Missing Value Analysis
What you covered:
- Null counts and null percentages.
- Empty-string checks and combined null/empty diagnostics.

Data engineer learning:
- Missingness = null + blanks + malformed placeholders.

## Step 6: Data Type & Format Validation
What you covered:
- Date parsing validation.
- Pincode format/length checks.
- Object column review.

Data engineer learning:
- Format checks prevent silent quality errors in pipelines.

## Step 7: Domain Validation
What you covered:
- Negative value checks and date range checks.
- District/state cleaning logic and domain sanity checks.
- Karnataka/UP district inconsistency observations.

Data engineer learning:
- Domain validation should map to real-world constraints.

## Step 8: Cardinality & Distribution
What you covered:
- Unique states, districts, pincodes, dates.
- Districts-per-state and volume distribution checks.

Data engineer learning:
- Cardinality drives partitioning/indexing/storage strategy.

## Step 9: Cross-Column Consistency
What you covered:
- `pincode -> district` stability checks.
- `district -> state` stability checks.
- Conflict extraction and diagnostics.

Data engineer learning:
- Referential consistency is mandatory before conformed modeling.

## Step 10: Measures vs Dimensions Classification
What you covered:
- Explicit column classification (time/dimension/measure/derived).

Data engineer learning:
- Clear column roles reduce ambiguity in fact/dimension design.

## Step 11: Outlier Detection (Advanced)
What you covered:
- `total_enrollment` derived.
- Z-score and extreme-value scans.

Data engineer learning:
- Outliers may indicate either data defects or true business events.

## Step 12: Trend & Time Analysis (Advanced)
What you covered:
- Monthly trend (`date -> month`) analysis.
- Spike/drop checks and time-based comparisons.

Data engineer learning:
- Time trends convert static profiling into operational insight.

## Step 13: Data Quality Risk Summary
What you covered:
- Summary snapshots (`rows`, duplicates, null totals, unique states).
- Quality snapshot/risk indicators and readiness checks.

Data engineer learning:
- Always end EDA with a compact decision-oriented summary.

## Step 14: Documentation
What you covered:
- Final findings documentation:
  - Grain
  - Natural key
  - Identified issues
  - Data inconsistencies
  - Expected fixes
  - Modeling direction
- Report artifact generation.

Data engineer learning:
- EDA is incomplete without written, reproducible documentation.

## Current Completion Status
- 14-step framework: Covered.
- Advanced checks: Included (trend, anomalies, consistency, KPI/rule-style outputs).
- Revision recommendation: Keep one canonical notebook path and one canonical report output path.

## Minimum Outputs You Should Preserve
- `final_eda_summary_metrics.csv`
- `final_eda_risk_register.csv`
- `final_eda_rule_status.csv`
- `final_eda_findings.md`

## Fast Revision (Interview Mode)
1. Explain grain and natural key first.
2. Explain top 3 quality issues found.
3. Explain what you cleaned and why.
4. Explain cross-table consistency checks.
5. Explain final modeling direction and quality gates.
